                    Easysoft Oracle ODBC Driver ChangeLog
                    =====================================


begin dbox@fnal.gov changes:

2002/08/13 Fixed problem with unit-test of array inserts. All 19 unit 
tests report success now. The array inserts work properly and
probably always have, my unit test died on an assertion after informing 
the driver that it was about to perform an array insert. 
Cleaned up SQLGetInfo and SQLSetStmtAttr, gettting rid of lots of 
ugly #ifdefs while retaining functionality they supported. 

2002/06/26 fixed bind problem in oracle_functions.c which bound 
string characters with incorrect buffer length. Bound string inserts now
work properly. 

2002/06/24 Installed extensive tracing facilities. Setenv DEBUG 2 
reports on all SQLxxx functions called along with input parameters and
return status. Setenv DEBUG 3 reports on all OCIxxx functions 
called along with input parameters and return status. 

2002/06/06 fixed LD_PRELOAD/core dump problem for oracle 8.1.6 and 8.1.7 

2002/05/31 added reasonable comments to the unit tests fixed SQLPrepare 
so that it allocates space in the statement for the column ap
and ir descriptors instead of waiting for SQLBindCol to do it. 
This defect was causing libodbc++ (and hence RDBC) to core dump. 

2002/05/24 fixed a buffer overflow in getinfo1.c unit test program 

2002/05/23 refinements to unit tests, detect oracle client version and 
warn of 8.1.6/7 bug 

2002/05/22 more test tweaking, added a unit test to check for all the 
unixODBC and ORACLE environment setup that must happen prior
to the c programs in the test subdirectory executing successfully. 

2002/05/16 new unit test to exercise SQLGetInfo.c more fully, tests all 
valid inputs at the level of 'it accepts them and doesnt core dump'.
Testing all 177 valid inputs for correct functioning will take some effort! 

2002/05/14 bug fixes to some malloc/free code, added 'constructors' 
for ar and ir environment handles and asserts to try to catch struct
corruption at earliest possible time. 

2002/05/09 changed/added some unit tests 

2002/05/02 fixed unused var warnings and flow of control problems 
found by insure++ 

2002/04/03 SQLGetInfo.c now correctly reports that it supports transactions 
more testing of transaction capability 

2002/03/08 added commit/rollback capability through SQLEndTran, more 
tests for SQLColAttribute 

2002/03/06 took out spurious warning about stubbed function in SQLRowCount.c 
Changed oracle_functions.c to deal with float(126) and
integer (actually NUMBER(38,0) more correctly. 

2002/03/05 added functionality to oracle_functions.c more extensive 
testing of SQLColAttribute and SQLDescribeCol 

2002/02/26 more directory cleanup, remove generated files (i.e. Makefile) 
that automake should take care of from repository. 

2002/02/23 added some missing cases to the switch statement of 
SQLColAttribute.c 

2002/02/20 changed error reporting for stubbed out functions. Added 
function calls to unit tests in 'test' subdirectory. 

2002/02/11 rearranged project into subdirectories, featuring ./src 
and ./test subdirectories and re-worked Makefile.am Makefile.in etc.
Changed malloc/realloc/free function calls to GNU-style ORAMALLOC, 
ORAREALLOC, and ORAFREE macros which should
prevent double-freeing, or proceeding if memory is exhausted.
